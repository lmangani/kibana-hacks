# Kibana Hacks

This is my tiny collection of Kibana hack plugins. These work just like regular kibana plugins, drop the directory into installedPlugins. They can also be installed with the `./bin/kibana plugin` command, or could if I published archives. I guess if anyone uses them, maybe I will

These are deeply unsupported. If you think there's a bug in them, there probably is, fix it and submit a pull request.

I screwed that up, that's a chicken. Good enough.
